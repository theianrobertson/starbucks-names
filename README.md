# Starbucks Names

A little Python script to pull "hand-written" funny names and paste them on to pictures of Starbucks cups using Pillow.

Big shout out to Adam Graves, I'm totally poaching results from his [recurrent neural network handwriting generation demo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/handwriting.cgi).  I'd like to think that he'd be down with this usage.

## How to do it
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pull_names.py somefunnyname
python merger.py somefunnyname
python twitter.py
```
